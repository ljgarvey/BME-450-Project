## Project Description
  This project aims to train a neural network that will be able to differentiate between lions or cheetahs from various images. This includes different angles or views of the animal, different surrounding landscapes, and includes things like pictures, statues, or figures of the animals. The dataset used for this project will be one provided by Kaggle.com which contains two sets of 100 images of cheetas and lions, as well as animals that look similar to them in the dataset i.e. a giraffe in the cheetah set to make the neural network rely on more than just if it is a spotted animal.
